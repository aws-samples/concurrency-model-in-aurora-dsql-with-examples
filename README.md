## Concurrency model retry logic demo with example

In Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC), implementing backoff and jitter is crucial for managing retries when transactions conflict. Backoff ensures that after a conflict, retries are not immediate but spaced out with progressively longer delays, helping to reduce system load. Jitter introduces randomness to these delays, avoiding synchronized retries that could potentially lead to further conflicts or system overload. Together, backoff and jitter reduce contention and enhance the retry logic’s efficiency in distributed systems employing OCC.  For a deeper dive, refer to theAWS blog on this subject.
Let’s now walk through a scenario where we simulate an OCC exception in a high-transaction environment and manage retries using backoff and jitter strategies.

Step 1: Create the Schema and Tables
First, use the `create.py` script to create an order schema and two tables: accounts and orders.
```python
python create.py --host <endpoint>  --database postgres --user <user_name> --region <region>  --schema orders`
```

Step 2: Generate Load
Run the `load_generator.py` script to generate load for the database, inserting data into the orders table.
```python
python load_generator.py --host <endpoint>  --database postgres --user <user_name> --region <region> --schema orders --tablename orders --threads 10
```

Step 3: Simulate OCC Exception
To introduce an OCC condition, alter the accounts table by adding a new column in another PostgreSQL session.
`ALTER TABLE order.accounts ADD COLUMN balance INT;`

Once the schema is updated, the load_generator.py script will fail with the following error:

```
Error during insert: schema has been updated by another transaction, please retry: (OC001)
```

Step 4: Implement Backoff and Jitter
Now, let's integrate backoff and jitter into the retry logic by running the `retry_backoff_jitter.py` script, an enhanced version of the `load_generator.py` script with built-in retry mechanisms.

```python
python retry_backoff_jitter.py --host <endpoint>  --database postgres --user <user_name> --region <region>  --schema orders --tablename orders --threads 10
```

Now, introduce another schema change in the accounts table.
`ALTER TABLE order.accounts ADD COLUMN totalsale INT;`

As the retry logic kicks in, you’ll see the script handling the OCC exception with retries:

```
Error during batch insert: schema has been updated by another transaction, please retry: (OC001), retrying in 2.11 seconds (attempt 1/5)
Error during batch insert: schema has been updated by another transaction, please retry: (OC001), retrying in 2.03 seconds (attempt 2/5)
```

This can be fine-tuned based on the retry strategy. In this case, we are using seconds for the delay.

In conclusion, efficiently handling OCC exceptions in distributed systems requires a robust retry mechanism. By integrating backoff and jitter into your retry strategy, you can minimize contention, avoid additional conflicts, and ensure your system recovers smoothly from transaction errors. This approach is critical for maintaining stability in high-transaction environments, especially in distributed databases. While we've focused on retry logic, it's also important to consider idempotency, which we haven't covered in this blog. Implementing idempotency ensures that retries don’t result in duplicated operations or inconsistent data, further enhancing the reliability of your system. Additionally, having a dead letter queue in place for persistent failures allows for escalation and manual intervention when necessary.
